Welcome!
You find yourself staring towards the horizon, with nothing but silence surrounding you.
You look east, then south, then west, all you can see is a great wasteland of nothingness.
Turning to your north you notice a small flicker of light in the distance.
You walk north towards the flicker of light, only to be stopped by some type of invisible barrier.  
The air around you begins to get thicker, and your heart begins to beat against your chest. 
You turn to your left.. then to your right!  You are trapped!
You fumble through your pockets.. nothing!  
You look down and see you are standing in sand.  
Dropping to your knees you begin to dig frantically.
As you dig you notice the barrier extends underground!  
Frantically you keep digging and digging until your nails suddenly catch on an object.
You dig further and discover a small wooden box.  
flag1{e6078b9b1aac915d11b9fd59791030bf} is engraved on the lid.
You open the box, and find a parchment with the following written on it. "Chant the string of flag1 - u666"

A loud crack of thunder sounds as you are knocked to your feet!
Dazed, you start to feel fresh air entering your lungs.
You are free!
In front of you written in the sand are the words:
flag2{c39cd4df8f2e35d20d92c2e44de5f7c6}
As you stand to your feet you notice that you can no longer see the flicker of light in the distance.
You turn frantically looking in all directions until suddenly, a murder of crows appear on the horizon.
As they get closer you can see one of the crows is grasping on to an object. As the sun hits the object, shards of light beam from its surface.
The birds get closer, and closer, and closer.
Staring up at the crows you can see they are in a formation.
Squinting your eyes from the light coming from the object, you can see the formation looks like the numeral 80.
As quickly as the birds appeared, they have left you once again.... alone... tortured by the deafening sound of silence.
666 is closed.
